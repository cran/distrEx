#  News: to package distrEx
######################################################################

##############
v 0.4-4 
##############

* dim() method for DiscreteMVDistribution 
* var() + E() overloaded for DExp-Class 
* sd()-method  overwritten for Norm-Class to allow function / condition argument

##############
v 0.4-3 
##############

*  Implementation of functionals:
   o evaluation of exact expressions of E (expectation functional) for most specific distributions from stats package
   o var, sd methods for UnivariateDistributions; these include calls like

     N <- Norm()

     var(N,function(t)abs(t)^(1/2))   # calculates Var[|N|^(1/2)] 

     also (factorized) conditional variance is available
   o evaluation of exact expressions of var for most specific distributions from stats package
   o median, IQR, mad methods for UnivariateDistributions
   o for var, sd, median, IQR, mad: all functionality/arguments of stats methods is/are preserved and
            only if first argument / argument x is of class UnivariateDistribution (or descendant) a 
            different method is applied
* Internationalization: use of gettext, gettextf in output
* C-interface .GLaw() to replace respective R-Code in distrExintegrate.R
* PrognCondDistribution, PrognCondition are included as classes and generating functions (incl. show-method); 
* Inclusion of demos (see above)
  + PrognCondDistribution, PrognCondition are included as classes and generating functions (incl. show-method); 
  + illustrateCLT is included and rd-file is done


##############
v 0.4-2 
##############

* ContaminationSize, HellingerDist, KolmogorovDist, TotalVarDist now return a list which consists of the corresponding distributions and their distance
* minor changes in m1df and m2df to increase speed of computation
* minor changes in DiscreteMVDistribution to increase speed of computation
* introduction of a new parameter useApply in methods for function E with default value TRUE
