distrExUse         This example illustrates how useful the functionals are in distrEx: code can be written once for all distributions...
illustCLT         This example illustrates how the CLT forces consecutive sums of iid r.v.'s to converge to a normal distribution; it uses
                  the E()- and sd()-methods from distrEx.   
Prognose          This example shows how the conditional distributions from distrEx can be used to achieve a general deconvolution method.
